# Sensor Logic and Implementation

The GlideSense project utilizes several sensors to monitor the windshield wiper's operation:

- **Vibration Sensor**: Measures the vibrations of the wiper. If the vibrations exceed a certain threshold, it indicates potential debris or dirt on the windshield.
- **Position Sensor**: Determines the current position of the wiper to adjust its behavior based on its location.

The sensor data is read and processed by the microcontroller, which uses it to make real-time adjustments to the wiper's pressure and speed.
