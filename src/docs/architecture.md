# System Architecture

The GlideSense system is designed to enhance the functionality of windshield wipers by integrating sensor data and adaptive control logic. The system consists of the following components:

- **Sensors**: Detect wiper position and vibrations to determine when cleaning is necessary.
- **Control Logic**: Adjusts the wiper's pressure and speed based on sensor inputs.
- **Microcontroller**: Interfaces with sensors and executes the control logic.
- **User Interface**: Allows manual control and configuration of the system.

The communication flow between these components ensures a responsive and efficient wiper system, improving visibility in various weather conditions.
