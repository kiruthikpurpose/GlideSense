# GlideSense

## Project Overview

**GlideSense** is an intelligent windshield wiper system designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of wiper blades by dynamically adjusting based on environmental factors and wiper performance. The system detects irregularities such as vibrations, dirt spots, or uneven wiping patterns, and makes real-time adjustments to correct the wiping action. This project simulates the core logic of GlideSense, with potential for integration into hardware systems such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

### Problem Statement

Traditional windshield wipers often encounter issues such as:
- **Inconsistent wiping**: Due to dirt, debris, or weather conditions, the wiper blades may vibrate or miss certain spots on the windshield.
- **Performance inefficiency**: Wiper blades are typically operated by simple repetitive motions, without accounting for irregularities in wiping performance.
- **Lack of adaptability**: Wiper systems are not reactive to specific conditions like debris buildup or wiper blade wear.

### Solution

**GlideSense** introduces an adaptive system that detects anomalies in the wiper blade movement, such as:
- **Vibration Detection**: Detects when wipers are not smoothly moving due to dirt or other obstructions.
- **Adaptive Control**: Adjusts the pressure or speed of the wipers based on detected irregularities.
- **Enhanced Cleaning**: Automatically increases pressure or changes wiper patterns when necessary to clear obstructed areas.

### Features and Improvements
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors wiper blade movement for irregularities.
- **Adaptive Pressure Control**: Adjusts the pressure applied by the wipers to ensure a thorough clean.
- **Extendable Architecture**: Designed with scalability in mind to allow integration into different platforms such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
- **Open Source Contribution**: Contributions are welcome to expand functionality, whether through optimization, hardware integration, or feature enhancement.

### Project Structure

The project is divided into several components:
- **Core (C language)**: The core logic responsible for the sensor simulation and adaptive control system.
- **Python Simulation**: A Python-based simulation for testing and extending functionality with machine learning capabilities.
- **Hardware**: Implementation files for Arduino and Raspberry Pi to support hardware testing and integration.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GlideSense.git
    cd GlideSense
    ```

2. Navigate to the `src/core` directory for the core C implementation, or the `hardware` directory for Arduino or Raspberry Pi integration.

3. Compile and run the core code (for example, in C):
    ```bash
    gcc -o glidesense main.c sensors.c control.c utils.c -lm
    ./glidesense
    ```
